        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          The company was releasing multiple high-end ad products simultaneously, including a new AI-assisted platform and reworked legacy systems. Users and support teams required a unified Help Center system, clearer navigation, and repeatable patterns to reduce escalated support calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Audience included enterprise advertisers, power users, and internal support teams.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple product teams contributed content with competing priorities</li>
          <li>Legal and policy reviews limited how directly content could communicate</li>
          <li>Global distribution of Help Center content required standardized patterns to support international teams</li>
          <li>Fast product release cadence demanded adaptable documentation</li>
          <li>Support team needed documentation that reduced escalations without increasing writing staff</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I approached this work as a systems design challenge rather than a documentation task, focusing on clarity, reusability, and adoption across multiple teams.
        </p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Interviewed stakeholders and support agents to identify top confusion points</li>
          <li>Audited existing content to locate redundancies, contradictions, and outdated flows</li>
          <li>Mapped user journeys for key tasks: Set Up, Bid Optimization, and Troubleshoot</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early Direction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a new information architecture organized by task-based grouping</li>
          <li>Created a modular article template: Problem → Steps → Confirmation → Variants</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Iterations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tested layouts with internal teams to improve scannability and comprehension</li>
          <li>Consolidated legacy pages into a single troubleshooting system</li>
          <li>Replaced long paragraphs with structured How-To patterns and expandable sections</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Key Decisions & Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Help Center organized around user needs rather than product divisions</li>
          <li>Standardized tone and terminology across product families</li>
          <li>Implemented reusable modules for recurring instructions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Rationale:</strong> Reduce decision friction, maintain clarity and consistency, and enable scalable adoption across teams without central bottlenecks.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <h3>Quantitative</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>~20% reduction in escalated support tickets for two major ad products</li>
          <li>40% decrease in content rewrite time for quarterly releases</li>
          <li>Article count reduced from ~300 → ~180 without losing information</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Qualitative</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Support team adopted new troubleshooting format across all verticals</li>
          <li>PMs reported fewer support calls related to new product changes</li>
          <li>Internal teams cited increased trust in documentation accuracy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What This Demonstrates</h2>
        <p>
          This project reflects how scalable content systems can improve user comprehension, reduce support burden, and maintain consistency across rapidly evolving products. It demonstrates my ability to design content frameworks that scale and endure.
