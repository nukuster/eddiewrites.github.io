  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This work took place within a large organization where multiple teams produced content at scale across platforms. Copy was authored independently, with competing priorities and fragmented communication norms, leading to inconsistent tone and terminology, engineering-first language, and slow review cycles. Without a shared strategic language or consistent patterns, maintaining clarity, cohesion, and scalability across products was a challenge.

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Content across Equinix platforms was authored independently by multiple teams. This resulted in inconsistent tone and terminology, engineering-first language that increased user friction, and no shared system to support clarity or scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Review cycles slowed, and the brand voice fragmented across products.
        </p>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Global, technical and non-technical audience with varied product familiarity</li>
          <li>Existing brand voice needed to be preserved</li>
          <li>No centralized content authority</li>
          <li>Solution had to be lightweight and easy to adopt</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">


        <h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
  I approached this problem as a systems design challenge rather than a writing task. 
  The goal was not to impose rules, but to reduce decision friction by clarifying principles, mapping language decisions, 
  and introducing shared frameworks that teams could adapt without central bottlenecks.
</p>

        <h3>Assess</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Audited UI copy, documentation, and marketing content</li>
          <li>Reviewed existing style documentation to identify gaps and adoption barriers</li>
          <li>Mapped high-friction areas, including CTAs, error states, onboarding, and empty states</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Systemize</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Built a reusable microcopy framework covering:
            <ul>
              <li>CTAs</li>
              <li>Success and error states</li>
              <li>Form labels</li>
              <li>Empty states</li>
              <li>Onboarding flows</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Defined voice principles emphasizing clarity, precision, and reduced jargon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enable Adoption</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Partnered with design and product leads to validate tone decisions</li>
          <li>Created before/after examples to demonstrate impact</li>
          <li>Added inclusive writing and accessibility guidance</li>
          <li>Delivered templates and quick-reference patterns for daily use</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Key Decisions & Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Favored reusable patterns over rigid rules</li>
          <li>Used examples to encourage adoption rather than enforcement</li>
          <li>Anchored tone guidance in existing brand principles</li>
          <li>Aligned naming and message hierarchy across teams</li>
        </ul>
	 <p>
          <strong>Rationale:</strong> Reduce writer workload, increase clarity, and enable users to find answers without needing support escalation.
        </p>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing system adopted by multiple product teams</li>
          <li>Improved consistency across UI and documentation</li>
          <li>Designers and PMs referenced the guide during reviews</li>
          <li>Reduced revision cycles due to shared language patterns</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

<section class="case-study-section case-study-demonstrates">
  <h2>What This Demonstrates</h2>
  <p>
    This case reflects my approach to enterprise content strategy: designing language systems that reduce friction,
    scale across teams, and hold up under real operational pressure.

      <section class="case-study-section case-study-takeaway">
        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          Writing systems scale best when they reduce decision friction for teams while preserving brand integrity.
