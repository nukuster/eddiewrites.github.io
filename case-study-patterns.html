        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          In high-stress classroom settings, inconsistent or ambiguous language can increase cognitive load and emotional escalation. I explored how a predictable communication system might reduce this friction by standardizing instruction and redirection language.
        </p>
      </section>

    <!--  <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Classroom communication varied significantly between instructors, resulting in confusing or contradictory instructions, cognitive overload during transitions, and emotional escalation when feedback or redirection was unclear. 
          There was no shared language system for instructions, expectations, or behavioral redirection.
        </p>
      </section> -->

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Varying regulation needs, including neurodivergent profiles</li>
          <li>Language needed to be simple, predictable, and emotionally neutral</li>
          <li>Guidance that was easy to remember and apply in real time</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I approached this work as a language systems design problem, focusing on predictability, emotional regulation, and repeatable patterns rather than individual phrases.
        </p>

        <h3>Diagnose</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Observed classroom interactions and instruction handoffs</li>
          <li>Identified points of breakdown during transitions and corrective moments</li>
          <li>Analyzed how language ambiguity increased emotional load</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design the System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a repeatable microcopy pattern set for instructions, expectations, and feedback</li>
          <li>Developed a step-based flow for high-friction moments: Pause → Clarify → Check Understanding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enable Consistency</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rewrote common classroom scripts using regulated, inclusive language</li>
          <li>Designed patterns that prioritized predictability and emotional safety</li>
          <li>Ensured language worked under time pressure and stress</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Design Intent</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce student escalation during transitions</li>
          <li>Increased clarity and consistency in classroom instructions</li>
          <li>Improved staff confidence when redirecting behavior</li>
          <li>More predictable classroom flow for students sensitive to ambiguity</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section case-study-demonstrates">
        <h2>What This Demonstrates</h2>
        <p>
          This case demonstrates how pattern-based language design can support emotional regulation, accessibility, and consistency in high-friction environments, showing the same systems thinking and strategic clarity applied in enterprise contexts.
