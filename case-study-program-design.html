        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
         A private elementary school in San Francisco sought to introduce a gardening class for grades 1–4 without an existing curriculum, requiring a program that could engage mixed-age students while delivering clear enrichment value. I was contracted to design and lead an 8-week pilot, applying my experience in rapidly entering unfamiliar domains and building structured, emotionally safe learning systems to create an effective, age-inclusive curriculum.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wide developmental range within a single classroom</li>
          <li>Limited gardening infrastructure and time</li>
          <li>No pre-existing curriculum or behavioral framework</li>
          <li>Short pilot timeline with no guarantee of continuation</li>
          <li>Program needed to justify renewal through observable outcomes</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I approached the project as a program and systems design challenge rather than a subject-matter teaching task.
        </p>

        <h3>System Framing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Defined <strong>assets</strong> as plants — living entities with needs, limits, and feedback</li>
          <li>Defined <strong>structure</strong> as tools, planters, routines, and rules</li>
          <li>Used cause-and-effect interactions to make outcomes visible and understandable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progressive Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Observation-based learning (plant identification before apps or phones)</li>
          <li>Ecosystem logic (soil health, roots, beneficial vs. harmful insects)</li>
          <li>Decision-making under constraints (what to plant, where, and why)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Emergent Social & Emotional Learning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Boundary-setting through shared tools and space</li>
          <li>Conflict repair following plant damage or mistakes</li>
          <li>Shared responsibility encouraged patience, fairness, and collaboration</li>
          <li>Rules and routines supported emotional regulation across age groups</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Key Decisions & Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed for emergent behavior rather than scripted outcomes</li>
          <li>Allowed failure to occur safely and visibly</li>
          <li>Embedded emotional learning into interaction rather than instruction</li>
          <li>Maintained consistent system rules to reduce ambiguity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Rationale:</strong> Systems that model clear feedback, limits, and repair naturally teach regulation and accountability without requiring didactic instruction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <h3>Program Results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The pilot program was extended beyond the initial 8 weeks</li>
          <li>The school requested that I return to teach an additional class</li>
          <li>The program was formally recognized as an enrichment offering</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Observed Impact</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved peer collaboration and conflict repair</li>
          <li>Higher engagement across age groups</li>
          <li>Transfer of learned behaviors into non-garden settings</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="case-study-section case-study-demonstrates">
        <h2>What This Demonstrates</h2>
        <p>
          This project demonstrates how system-driven design can support emotional literacy, agency, and learning without explicit instruction. The same principles apply to interactive products and games that address mental health themes, where safety, feedback, and player agency must be carefully balanced.
